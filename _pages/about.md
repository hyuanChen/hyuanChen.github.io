I'm a third year student from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) majoring in computer science.My research interest lies in 3D vision.My goal is to explore how a machine can **perceive** like a human.

During my second year study in Jilin University, I worked with Professor [Ximing Li](https://teachers.jlu.edu.cn/XimingLi/zh_CN/index.htm).

I'm a second year student from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) majoring in computer science.My research interest lies in Embodied AI&3D vision.My goal is to understand how a machine can perceive and act like a human, as well as how computer vision acquires supervision or reward from the environment.

During my second year study in Jilin University, I worked with Professor [Ximing Li](https://teachers.jlu.edu.cn/XimingLi/zh_CN/index.htm)

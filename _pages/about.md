I'm a second year student from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) majoring in computer science.My research interest lies in **novel technologies that facilitate human life**. 

During my second year study in Jilin University, I worked with Professor [Ximing Li](https://teachers.jlu.edu.cn/XimingLi/zh_CN/index.htm), mainly worked on short-text retrieval.

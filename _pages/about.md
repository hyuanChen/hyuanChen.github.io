I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of CCST](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/), [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes AIGC content and Multimodal.

During my second year study in Jilin University, I worked with Professor [Ximin Li](https://teachers.jlu.edu.cn/XimingLi/zh_CN/index.htm), mainly worked on short-text retrieval.

You can find my Chinese CV here: [Hongyuan's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

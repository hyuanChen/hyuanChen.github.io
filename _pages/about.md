I'm a second year student from [School of CCST](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/), [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/).My research interest lies in novel technologies that facilitate human life. 

During my second year study in Jilin University, I worked with Professor [Ximing Li](https://teachers.jlu.edu.cn/XimingLi/zh_CN/index.htm), mainly worked on short-text retrieval.

You can find my Chinese CV here: [Hongyuan's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
